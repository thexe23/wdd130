      Hi There! I'm Harlan Sun, a software developer.
      About Me
      Hi, I'm Harlan Sun! I'm a student at BYU-Idaho and I major in software development. I have been doing frontend
      development for 2 years. Last year, I worked on a ctypto wallet called Pawket. During that time, I learned how to

      apps, or solving
      technical problems, I am up for the challenge.
      Feel free to explore my portfolio, where I showcase some of my best projects. If you have any inquiries,
      collaboration proposals, or just want to say hello, don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm excited to connect with
      fellow developers, entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to
      hearing from you!
