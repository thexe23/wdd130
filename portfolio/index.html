                About Me
                Hi, I'm Harlan Sun! I'm a student at BYU-Idaho and I major in software development. I have been doing
                frontend
                development for 2 years. Last year, I worked on a ctypto wallet called Pawket. During that time, I
                learned how to
                use Vue.js to create webpages and also refined my html, css and Javascript skills.
                I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it's building web applications,
                developing mobile
                apps, or solving
                technical problems, I am up for the challenge.
                Feel free to explore my portfolio, where I showcase some of my best projects. If you have any inquiries,
                collaboration proposals, or just want to say hello, don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm excited to
                connect with
                fellow developers, entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look
                forward to
                hearing from you!
