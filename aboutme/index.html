    <h2>Harlan Sun</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Harlan, and I'm originally from China, but I currently live in Roy, Utah.</p>
    <p>
      I've only been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for about a year. I met three wonderful Chinese
      missionaries when I was living in San Jose, California, and I was baptized on April 30th, 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy following the NBA, and my favorite team and player are the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James.
      Besides basketball, I also enjoy hiking and appreciating the beautiful scenery around me!
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I'm excited to learn with you all in this course!</p>
